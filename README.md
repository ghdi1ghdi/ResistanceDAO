Our NFT Project, "ResistanceDAO" is based on "ReactJS", "TypeScript", "NodeJS", "MySQL", and "Solidity".

This project is constructed by our NFT team, "AIR3.0".

## Project Description

Myanmar's military has arrested and detained numerous journalists who wrote articles against the dictatorship. In another case, in 2016, a Malaysian media company was blocked and suspended from publishing servers for unfair reasons after writing articles revealing corruption by political figures. In addition, some media around the world are sometimes suppressed by certain forces. Through this series of events, we have been able to feel the need for a media platform that can be maintained unabated by oppression. So we planned a project to help create a better society by re-examining important but forgotten issues through collective intelligence. The service we developed has the following process. 1. Log in to the wallet. -Metamask. Sign in and sign up through the most popular meta-mask wallet. -Connecting the Byprost Wallet. Log in and sign up as a Byprost Wallet. 2. Create. -Create Function. Only NFT holders can create posts. -Like / Hate Function. Posts are good You can press "No". You can change your likes/dislikes anytime for the rest of your life.  3. Selection function. - The number of posts (likes-dislikes) within a week's period is selected up to 2nd. At first, there may not be many posts, so it may be up to 2nd place, it may change later. 4. Voting function. -Expose Selected Posts. Two articles selected and exposed on bulletin board. -voting functiont. Resistance NFT owners  can vote on selected articles. it can only vote for one of the two posts. The period is available for a week. Within the period, the vote can be changed. After the period, the vote cannot be changed. Readable even if you are not the owner. 5. NFT conversion of posts. -Ability to NFT selected posts. Through this process, we can expect the following effects. 1. Through this, we can inform people in interesting ways that can be forgotten. 2. Using "NFT" prevents articles from being deleted under external pressure. 3. Through the sponsorship system, we can contribute to the realization of social justice. 4. By getting many people to use this content, we can promote the chain through issueization. What we wanted to further develop this service is as follows. 1. Development of AI to check facts about articles provided. 2. Creating and specifying criteria for selecting articles to ensure neutrality. 3. Development of voting period, voting and selection methods, etc To sum up, We have created an undeleted and unaffected media management system consisting of the autonomy and will of the members of the "DAO". If we strengthen the rules that uphold media quality, neutrality, etc. through trial and error in the future, this will protect the media brilliantly from external pressure. And the people's interest in this project will be of infinite value depending on how we use it.

## Challenges faced and Technology or Ideas used to solve them

Resistance DAO plays a significant role in various aspects of post creation, ownership, protection, voting, and selection by leveraging NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Through these applications, Resistance DAO supports interaction and autonomous operation among participants, while fostering interest in important issues and societal impact. Managing post creation and ownership through NFTs ensures ownership and control over important content. Resistance DAO grants post creation rights exclusively to NFT holders, enabling fair generation and maintenance of significant content. Moreover, using NFTs to protect posts ensures their preservation without being deleted under external pressures. Each post is represented by a unique NFT, providing secure protection against potential threats. By employing NFTs in the voting and selection process, participants can engage in the selection and sharing of important content. NFT owners can vote for their preferred posts, directly participating in the decision-making on significant issues. Additionally, the feature to convert selected posts into NFTs allows the representation of their value as unique NFTs. Voted posts are issued as distinct NFTs, which can subsequently be traded or owned by NFT owners. This utilization of NFTs plays a pivotal role in Resistance DAO by supporting participant interaction, autonomous operation, and promoting interest and social influence on important issues. This enables the establishment of a sustainable media platform liberated from oppression and facilitates ongoing efforts to create a better society. Resistance DAO employs DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization) technically to build and operate the project. It encompasses various aspects such as autonomous decision-making, maintaining transparency and trust, providing rewards and incentives, executing smart contracts, and decentralized asset management. DAO members can make autonomous decisions by participating in voting and expressing opinions regarding the project's direction and operations. Smart contracts and DAO management tools automate and execute the voting and decision-making process. To ensure transparency and trust, DAO utilizes blockchain technology to immutably record and publicly disclose all transactions and decisions, fostering trust among members and guaranteeing project transparency. Reward and incentive mechanisms are established within DAO to compensate and incentivize members who contribute to the project. Smart contracts and tokens can be used to implement these reward systems, encouraging greater participation and contribution, and fostering the growth and development of the project. By executing automated processes and conditional logic through smart contracts, DAO efficiently manages voting features, execution of decisions based on voting results, and distribution of rewards, automating project operations and ensuring transparency. Decentralized asset management plays a crucial role in DAO. In Resistance DAO, posts and voting results are managed using NFTs and smart contracts, facilitating decentralized ownership and transfers of assets. Through these approaches, Resistance DAO leverages DAO technically to realize autonomous organizational operation, transparent decision-making, implementation of reward mechanisms, and the construction of a project free from centralized control and external pressures. This innovative approach improves media platforms and societal influence, providing an opportunity to create a better society based on participants' interest and ongoing efforts.
